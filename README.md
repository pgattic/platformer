# Platformer  
Simple HTML5 Platformer game with a level editor. The editor can export and import levels in JSON format to be shared.  

Play the game [here](https://pgattic.github.io/platformer).  
Make your own levels [here](https://pgattic.github.io/platformer/level-editor).  

Thanks for playing! I know this is a really simple project but I would love to hear about suggestions or bugs!

### To-do:  

* Allow creation and importing of multiple levels at once, to be played sequentially  
* Store main game's levels as JSON as well  
* Better graphics?  
* Some kind of enemies to kill
